	<p>Outside of school this year, I spent time with my friends. I played a lot of soccer and went to a Backseat Lovers conert with friends. I also went on a volunteer trip to Mexico to build a house, and travelled to Carmel and Massachusetts with my family. I really enjoyed all these activities and gave me a nice break from my academics. </p>
