	<p>During the 2022-2023 school year I took 8 different classes. My favorite was probably Law+Society though Honors Chemistry was definietly the hardest. I read a lot of books in English, learned new tenses in Spanish and did a lot of new stuff in math. Overall, I learned a lot from through my classes and feel (mostly) ready for Junior year. </p>
